He falls into a barrel of toxic waste and goes through a horrible meltdown, but thats okay because he returns as THE TOXIC AVENGER. Armed with a mop, he seeks revenge on the horrible jocks and their snob-ass girlfriends, as well as the local cretins, thugs and just all-around bad-guys who make up Tromaville. This is one of my favorite movies, right along with Troma's Terror Firmer, and if that sounds lame then keep reading. Troma made a couple of bad-taste teen comedies before this that basically ripped off Porky's, but were in a more Airplane/Naked Gun league with dirtier, piggish, arm-pitted humor. Here, they took those aspects, added a lot of gore (in a comic-book way) and added a Mad Magazine mentality and created one hell of a good movie. There is a lot of violence in this, but if you can take violence, then you will see the humor here. Like I said it's like Mad Magazine. Bad-taste, gratuitous nudity, and racial slurs run rampant, but it comes off as a slap in the face to all the types of people who glorify that type of thing. It's good gory fun. This is the movie that put Troma on the map. They have made some of the best B movies out there. Class Of Nuke'em High, Troma's War, Tromeo And Juliet are all worth a look. They have released films by other people that are good too. Blood Hook, Cannibal!The Musical, Dead Dudes In The House prove to be good views. See this if you like movies. The sequels to The Toxic Avenger are not bad. The fourth being the best, the third being the worst.

It has all the aces. Firstly, amazing stories and people happening in small towns too who are crying to be a part of mainstream but nobody really took notice of them. No need to add situational/ item numbers (read non situational)songs or beautiful bimbettes in the name of \\\"heroines\\\". Instead a brother-sister combo is remarkably portrayed.

The honors should equally be shared by background score, songs, cinematography, editing (especially), sound design and script. All performances are first rate.

The last I knew, filmmakers such as Hitchcock and Preminger relied upon them incessantly. A twist in plot, if carried off well, can satisfy viewers and fire the imagination.Personally, I find the romantic drama as a genre in dire need of a wake-up call. Films such as this one, Closer, Unfaithful, Wicker Park, and very few others, are daring to attempt something original, whether it be a more frank look at relationships, a less clich\\u00e9d or sexist view of infidelity, or a new take on the love triangle... and by new I mean new in both this film and Wicker Park.

Lord of War while a good movie technically--the acting is sound, the story is relatively tight, and it has a good \\\"texture\\\" to it for what it's trying to portray\\u0097it is not a well-balanced movie and portrays a worldview of hopelessness and will-to-power fatalism. The world is grey, ethically, politically, socially. The only way to navigate a grey world is to wield the most power and don't allow yourself to think about the rest. \\\"There are three way to sell arms. White-legally, Black-illegally, and, my personal favorite, grey.\\\" says the film's main character.Lord of War feels almost like a documentary as it traces the life of a very successful arms trafficker Yuri Orlov (Cage). Orlov is a man of almost no feeling, certainly one of no moral sense, and who is extremely talented at selling arms internationally. Orlov travels the globe selling small and large arms literally to anyone who will buy while evading the law, bribing officials, doing drugs, and having sex. By the end of the movie Orlov is legally untouchable though he's not megalomaniacal. He has a good sense of his place and wields his power by filling his role with precision.Lord of War is cynical both in it's view of the world and it's portrayal of the human response to evil. Actually, in this film, there are no neat distinctions between good and evil. The line that sums up the movie best were in the mouth of Orlov, \\\"They say that evil prevails when good men do nothing... Actually what they should say is that evil prevails.\\\" Agent Jack Valentine (Hawke) plays an innocuous would-be spoiler to Orlov's cynicism and play far too minor a role in this film in this writer's opinion. Valentine still believes in right and wrong but seems to have no adequate answers to Orlov's frequent a-moralizing. The feeling you get is that there are no answers and that's why /director Andrew Niccol puts none in the mouth of Valentine.The movie is somewhat drab and methodical partly because Niccol wants us to focus on the message not the special effects or even the technical details. This film, like so many modern films has no hero. Valentine is powerless, the U.N. is corrupt and impotent, there's no world leader that isn't self-absorbed, and even friends and family are motivated by drugs and money. Niccol, who wrote the screenplay for one of my favorite movies, The Truman Show, may now see clearly the outcome of facing a world without God\\u0097moral decision making becomes very difficult if not impossible. Cynicism is the last defense.Still, for all the film's cynicism, fatalism, and amorality, Niccol clearly doesn't participate in the same worldview as his anti-hero. Niccol clearly wants us to walk out of the movie with a clear moral message: guns are bad and the people that sell them (the US, George Bush, and other members of the U.N. Security Council) are evil. Niccol seems to have no problem making clear moral judgments.

Blake is the next victim as Freddy's name is spread through the local high-school, shortly after Freddy is strong enough to terrorise the children of Elm Street again but he has competition in the form of the seemingly unstoppable Jason. The residents of Springfield are not safe either awake or asleep...Directed by Ronny Yu I though Freddy Vs. Jason was terrific fun, especially if your a die hard horror buff like myself! The script by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift is incredibly silly & not to be taken seriously but makes for good fun & entertainment. Freddy Vs. Jason moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring, something is always happening & it's a nice tight well paced film. There are plenty of film homages & it has a definite sense of fun. While the characters aren't particularly original or well developed they are likable & have just enough about them to care for. There are plenty of one liners & quips & the dialogue isn't exactly absorbing but it suits the comic book feel of the film very well. Between them Freddy & Jason have starred in no less than 17 films (I have seen them all) before Freddy Vs. Jason (plus Freddy got his own TV series) & are perhaps two of my favourite & greatest horror icons ever to grace the silver screen, well I think so anyway so I got a big kick out of seeing these characters that I grew up with in the same film. Director Yu treats them with respect & are instantly familiar & still look pretty imposing even in 2003 some 20 odd years after they first appeared. Director Yu treats us to some serious over-the-top violence which by the end becomes very comic book like, there are plenty of machete violence, stabbings, decapitations, someone is cut in half, arms are ripped off & gory fights galore. Some of the CGI effects are a little fake looking but the make-up effects are a lot better with plenty of spurting blood. There is a strong action element to Freddy Vs. Jason & Yu brings his experience to create some great choreographed fights between Freddy & Jason which become more & more outrageous as the film goes on. The acting is about as good as you would expect from a film such as this but I thought everyone did OK & no one was trying to win an Oscar were they? Even singer Kelly Rowlan didn't annoy me which was a surprise as 'hip' singers don't usually make for good actors. Technically the film is impressive & with a fairly healthy budget of about $25,000,000 that's the least I'd expect. The music mixes familiar tunes & cues from both series of films which helped get me in the mood although I didn't like the annoying rock tracks that much. I liked Freddy Vs. Jason a lot, the filmmakers did a much better job than I could have hoped for. The idea is ridiculous & if you are not into horror then forget it but since I am & I am a definite fan of these two characters I found myself enjoying every overblown, silly but hugely entertaining minute of it!

This is one of his first personal movies, describing the raw environment in the streets of Little Italy in NYC. We follow Charlie in the leading role and the bunch of guys around him. The hustler Johnny Boy owes a lot of money to the loan shark Tony and doesn't make his payments to him. Charlie now tries to work out a deal with Tony and is trying to get Johnny Boy to pull himself together, even though this looks like an impossible mission.Scorsese's first motion picture Who's That Knocking at My Door and Mean Streets have many resemblances and contain the typical trademarks that Scorsese is now well known for. He almost always makes a character study of the life of lonely men, who are trying to get the best out of their situation in the asphalt jungle. Hustling, working, drinking, taking drugs etc. are very typical things to do for the persons appearing in his movies.Mean Streets is photographed mostly with a hand hold camera, which helps create a raw look that fits pretty good to this environment. Also the movie doesn't contain an actual score. Actually songs from the director's personal music collection do work as the background music. The plot is this picture is only secondary. This is like many of Scorsese's other movie primarily a character driven story with a raw environment description.The movie marks the start of one of the greatest director/actor collaborations ever! The role of Johnny Boy was Robert De Niro's role in a Scorsese picture, and later on he went to bigger leading roles under the director, which gave them both the reputation that they have today. Also this is Harvey Keitel's second leading role in a Scorsese picture, but after this movie Keitel and De Niro kind switched roles (see Taxi Driver).This movie is not just a good movie - It also is the movie which helped form the foundation of Martin Scorsese's later pictures.8/10\", \"helpful\": [\"57\", \"94\"], \"title\": \"mean streets\", \"year\": \"1973\"}, {\"review_id\": \"rw1241191\", \"reviewer\": \"JimSDCal\", \"movie\": \"The Family Stone (2005)\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"review_summary\": \"A good Christmas comedy/drama\", \"review_date\": \"18 December 2005\", \"spoiler_tag\": 0, \"review_detail\": \"The Family Stone is a pretty good combination of comedy and drama.

There is very little information in this that can't be gotten out of a grade school level book. The series makes very simple, obvious assertions about the universe and stretches them out for a half hour each. What's more is that it is strangely alarmist, giving the feeling that we could all die at any moment from some huge cataclysm. While that's true on some level, it's also extremely unlikely that a comet or asteroid will strike us out of the blue. To watch this series, you would think it was inevitable within our lifetimes.It also makes the assertion that the only hope for humanity's future lies in colonizing the stars. This may or may not be true. In the several billion years before this even becomes an issue, we may very well discover how to keep the sun burning longer, how to live in the vacuum of space, or any number of other things that would make that much less relevant. There is no pressing need to colonize other worlds right now, though I admit I love the idea of doing it.In all, outside of the alarmism, I suppose this would be good for someone who is very unfamiliar with astronomy in general.

Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself. Her outward expression projects her desire. That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.Along comes talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. He wants to become her student so as to be close to her. She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? It is hard to tell. Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She is a sex extreme freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. Actually that isn't even true. She says she doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. Love, she calls it. For her sex and love are one and the same.At one point Walter tells her that love isn't everything. How ironic such a superfluity is to her. How gratuitous the comment.The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within). He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone. Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. We don't need to see any more.The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul. Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to her is the performance and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too depraved. It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does. She is always fascinating and nearly flawless. She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentelli\\u00e8re) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. Her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets. (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.) In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty. Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La C\\u00e9r\\u00e9monie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.Do see this for Isabelle Huppert.

Roy Huggins' (aka John Thomas James) thoughtful and professional approach was everywhere. Many of the most memorable moments within the series were based upon fact and/or documented historical incidents e.g. soap selling dodges, poker escapades, safe-cracking attempts, and - although I was unaware of this as a child - it explains why so much of the series' background 'hung true'. Toss in the amiable, laconic tit-tat verbal interplay between Hannibal Heyes (Pete Duel) and Kid Curry (Ben Murphy)... and you ended up with small-screen magic.Heyes followed the silver-tongued, 'I can talk us out of this calamity' approach, with endless undinted confidence and zest, but varying success; Curry, meanwhile, was content to watch him 'wing-it', then stepped in when catastrophe threatened - as it often did.It was the 'little things' that made this series soar, the consistency of character, the fallibility, the kicks of fate that tweaked Heyes and Curry into two magnetically likable 'pretty good bad men'. The delicate interplays between two men who would 'do to ride the river'.It was often the smallest stories that were the most successful, the ones where technically 'not a lot was happening'. For example, in one episode they got snowed-in, for the whole winter, in a remote mountain cabin... all very static? nope, just the opposite... what you got, was a heck of a lot of Heyes and Curry getting on with the business of making the best of a bad deal. Fantastic.This is the 'less is more' approach; so often lauded - but oh so rarely allowed onto the screen.

Over the top music, a few symbols here and there, rolling up the flag, a little religion and superstition and such amusing touches as a leitmotiv of incontinence for no apparent reason, this truly was 90 minutes where paint drying would have seemed vastly more exciting.

Imelda Staunton takes on the title role as a selfless matriarch that believes every problem can be solved with a cup of tea and a jaunty, if not annoying, hum. Vera copes with post war Britain with ease, holding together her interdependent family as she moves around the community, cleaning upper class houses and looking after those in need; always with a smile and a kind word on her lips. But Vera has a secret. In 1950's Britain abortion was illegal, certainly without the consent of highly paid medical professionals and psychiatrists. Vera's response to this is to perform \\\"backstreet\\\" terminations, helping girls \\\"in trouble\\\" by a non draconian method involving a syringe, soapy water and a detergent. This is not supposed to be a tirade supporting or condemning the pro life debate, just the story of one woman who truly believes what she is doing is right. Vera Drake was nominated for a plethora of awards, winning many of them, unsurprisingly as it ticks all the right boxes to gain the attention of the awarding bodies. The brilliant performances, the heavy and controversial subject matter and the attention to detail are all established steps along the road to awards-ville. Unfortunately this period of Britain and the characters portrayed have been parodied over recent years by some of the best comedic talents that Britain has to offer. Instead of being immersed within the narrative (as many people were) I was constantly reminded of the similarities between Vera Drake and Julie Waters's Mrs Overall from Acorn Antiques. This journey into my own little world was strengthened when Jim Broadbent turned up in a minor role as a judge. This is a walk on part! There is no character for him to develop or get his teeth into and he is too recognisable to believe he is anyone other than Jim Broadbent. I felt like the audience should erupt into the polite applause of cricket spectators as someone calls out \\\"Jim Broadbent ladies and gentlemen, round of applause for Mr Jim Broadbent\\\" His links to Victoria Woods and Julie Waters did nothing to stop my Acorn Antiques delusion, although at least I was able to entertain myself. I found the film repetitive, with the abortion sequences being repeated several times with diverse clients. It did not need this many different portrayals for the audience to understand what it is Vera Drake does, one or two would have sufficed. The everyday mundane nature of these operations is already emphasised due to Vera Drake handling them in the everyday manor of someone cleaning a toilet bowl. It is this flogging of the proletarian working class groundhog day-esquire life that drains the most, and at over two hours this film is a trial to sit through. This post war working class world is superbly represented down to the last detail; but at the cost of the narrative. A prime example of this is when Vera unpacks her shopping bag one item at a time so that the audience can marvel at the recreation of 1950's tins of food. I personally did not enjoy this film, would not watch it again and have put off even writing this review for as long as I could. Many people have tried to open my eyes and show me the beauty of this film, but I remain in the dark. Vera Drake was just not my Cup of Tea.

Nor is it happy. Nor humorous. Yet, somehow director Jean-Pierre Jeunet discovers glimpses of fun, happiness and humor amidst the agony of war, the pain of loss, the desperation of clinging to false hopes and the unique darkness of being condemned by one's own. Where else is a viewer going to see a grisly film, essentially about how French World War One soldiers who were accused (sometimes falsely) of self-mutilation to try to get sent home from the front but instead find themselves forced unarmed into the no-man's land between the French and German trenches as punishment, that still succeeds in making him laugh? Absurd but true. At times this film is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 1957 \\\"Paths of Glory\\\" until the time frame changes and it presents a Forrest Gump-like innocence. Audrey Tautou (\\\"Amelie\\\") is perfect in the role of Mathilde, the fianc\\u00e9e who believes that her betrothed somehow survived his doom, but the direction is so precise, the cinematography so convincing, that Jeunet probably would have succeeded with any capable actress.This long movie does not poke along like \\\"The English Patient.\\\" Instead, it lunges from time frame to time frame, alternately a love story, a horrifying war picture, a very violent revenge caper, a reflection on \\\"mental illness\\\" and a farcical comedy with a compelling mystery thread that denies the viewer the luxury of turning away from the screen. Mathilde deceives characters in supremely clever fashion as she undertakes a dubious effort to find her man alive; it may take a while for the viewer to realize that he too is being manipulated. This is the kind of production that only a collection of the most adept directors, screenwriters, producers, film and sound editors, make-up and costume designers, special effects wizards and cinematographers can make work. One hardly realizes that 133 minutes have passed when the film reaches its tear-jerking conclusion.Surprise! Jodie Foster enters the story to portray a painfully torn woman whose part in Tautou's grand ploy proves pivotal. She speaks French as if it were her native language. And from time to time we are treated to the methodically deadly antics of an assassin, a veritable Femme Nikita, who has vowed revenge on every French military officer responsible for her lover's death. These scenes are somewhat reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino, yet they linger only momentarily. Shock is not Jeunet's plan. Rather, frightening realism mixed with a subtly jovial underpinning mark this fascinating film.No viewer is left untouched by the conclusion of this saga. Thankfully, Jeunet remains respectable by not settling for the sentimental, not allowing his viewers to breathe any long-awaited sigh of satisfaction that it all works out in the end, although, in a way, it does. Unexpectedly, the viewer finds himself weeping, whether at the startling starkness of the reality that Mathilde finally uncovers or at the intrinsic beauty of a unique and unexpectedly delightful film set in a ravaged Great War-era France, the viewer may not be able to tell.

It made the movie much, much better.Yeah, it's more far-fetched than the other superhero movies because here, the hero is a blind guy who, because of his blindness, has extraordinary hearing powers along with the rest of the usual Batman/Spiderman-type athletic skills.As in most of the Batman films, this is a dark film. I think it would have been better had it lightened up a bit with a few jokes and a more wholesome female lead. Jennifer Garner is another one of these latter-day skinny chicks who is made to be tough-looking, tough-talking and tough-fighting. In other words: ridiculous. However, I will say she comes across a little more likable on the extended version. One more negative: the fight scenes go on a tad too long and are outlandish.On the positive side, this may be the best-sounding DVD I own, at least up to ones I had heard up until this came out in January of 2005. Since the hero (Ben Affleck) has super hearing, this is emphasized in this movie and so you, if you have a 5.1 surround system, hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!Affleck, meanwhile, is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow, you don't hear that much in movies.

I just recently reviewed Baby Face Nelson. Now I've seen Dillinger and I've had it.This movie is garbage. I don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like Bonnie and Clyde. This movie is far from a classic. Someone called it brilliant. That's an insane thing to say. This movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting I've ever seen. I don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast Warren Oates as John Dillinger. First of all he looks nothing like him. Second of all, by the time John Dillinger was killed he was 31. When Oates made this he was 45! You could even tell that he's older than the real Dillinger just by looking at him. Not only was he too old, but so was Ben Johnson as Melvin Purvis.They show Baby Face Nelson die, then Homer Van Meter, and finally John Dillinger. John Dillinger was killed before both of them. The last one to die out of the three was Baby Face Nelson. Not only do the writers not know when they died, but they also don't know how they died. Baby Face Nelson was not killed after he escaped from Little Bohemia in a robe. Homer Van Meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns. Homer Van Meter was cornered by the police in St. Paul and gunned down with machine guns. Another member of Dillinger's gang, Harry Pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie. Pierpont wasn't shot. Harry Pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair. I go into what happened to Baby Face Nelson on my Baby Face Nelson review so I'm not going to go into it again here. Let me also add that Richard Dreyfuss' portrayal of Baby Face Nelson is pathetic. There's a scene where he attacks Dillinger and then gets a bad beating. While Dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming, \\\"Leave me alone!\\\" Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger never fought. Maybe Dillinger didn't agree with Nelson's bank robbing methods, but they never fought. Nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten. They keep calling him Lester \\\"Baby Face\\\" Nelson. He was never in his life known by that name. Nelson's real name was Lester Gillis and he changed his name to George Nelson. The black guy that escaped from jail with Dillinger was Herbert Youngblood, but in this movie he is known as Reed Youngblood. John Milius doesn't know anything. Where the hell did John Milius get his information? I could probably make a better movie than him.Finally the way they showed John Dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable. The movie shows Dillinger walk out of the Biograph with the Lady in Red and his girlfriend Billie Frechette. By the way, Billie Frechette wasn't even there that night. But a girl named Polly Hamilton was. Melvin Purvis yells, 'Johnny!' Dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell. It is a proved fact that Dillinger did not have a gun that night. The FBI gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away. They didn't even have to shoot him. They were so close that powder burns were found on his face. It was murder. They also say that the man killed that night was not John Dillinger. After killing tons of civilians in the Little Bohemia incident can you imagine the FBI reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man? The gun they had on display that was supposedly on Dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after Dillinger's death. I could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't John Dillinger, but I'll stop here.

I will refer to this version of Titanic as the CZJ version for Catherine Zeta-Jones one of its most shining stars.I was far from being disappointed. The CZJ version was very different from its 1997 Cameron Academey Award winning successor. Whereas THE Titanic movie had great music, a single overarching love story and very expensive sets and special effects, the CZJ version gives the big boy a run for its money.CZJ has two love stories, adequate graphics and effects, ordinary music and average sets and costuming. Where the CZJ version shines is in the concentration of the story on a much broader range of characters and a lot more scenes portraying details of what actually happened from April 9-16, 1914 on the Titanic, California and Carpathia.Where CZJ really shines is in its casting and the performances of the stars. The well known stars: CZJ, Peter Gallagher, George C. Scott, Marilu Henner and Eva Marie Saint live up to their performances before and after this relatively unknown TV turn. The lesser known young players do an extremely credible job as well.As I am writing this I can't help comparing these performances to the ones it the big Titanic. In the big Titanic as far as I'm concerned the only decent performances were by players in the \\\"overstory\\\" i.e. the discovery and exploration of the sunken Titanic. These would be performances by Gloria Stuart and Bill Paxton. As far as Kate Winslet and Leornardo DeCrapio are concerned they were badly miscast and stunk up the whole film for me. Actually the real stars of big Titanic were James Cameron and Celine Dion.Overall,I rated both these versions just about equal.

Either way, I really really enjoyed Nine Songs, a relationship drama told strictly through sex. First, we'll list the failures. The acting of our female lead is a bit suspect and makes her, in the end, unlikable. The photography, although intimate and immediate, suffers from it's DV quality and makes you wonder how beautiful this film could have been shot with the eye of perhaps... Lars Von Trier's dogma lense. Most importantly, the movie relies on two ingredients that in the end prove a bit useless. We are reliving the story in memory via the male lead as he travels through Antarctica. Although it is an interesting metaphor and a captivating landscape, it seems almost entirely unnecessary. We hear him say \\\"you can be clostraphobic and agoraphobic all at the same time, much like the bedroom.\\\" Secondly, and most important, the live music is inconsequential, although good. The actual image quality is low, the songs play for too long, the lyrics apply to the narrative not at all, and the bands all flirt with one style (Michael Nyman being the exception). I must say, there is an outstanding version of \\\"Jacqueline\\\" by Franz Ferdinand.Now let me tell you where the film succeeds. We experience two young, naive, selfish personalities infatuated with one another, and the idea of one another. This is expressed in the most immediate and intimate fashion: SEX. We see two people in the prime of a relationship, in which the most sex is had, and as much as possible, however possible, symbolizing favors, trust, forgiveness, revenge, and all the other facets of a relationship. These scenes also succeed because of their length, the total lack of music, and the director's willingness to let them exist without explanation. Although these two characters are not even particularly likable or explained to us, we end up feeling as if we've shared something very deep with them, solely based on the extent to which we are asked to hang with them throughout the long and graphic and no holds barred sex scenes.It may seem sick, but by the end, as a graphic fellatio scene ends with actual ejaculation, you have become so acclimatized to this topic, and it being our main source of communication, that there is an almost unspoken dialogue between all parties. Instead of feeling offended, we feel love for the privacy of the moment, for the trust and sharing that happens there. Instead of feeling aroused, we feel compelled by the motives, interested in the roles played and mindful of the moment shared.By asking that you step into a theater, with total strangers, and watch many graphic sexual encounters, many unexplained and without the usual Hollywood ramp-up, you have signed over a certain amount of control and comfort as an audience-member, which in the end, offers a truly unique experience of the \\\"love story\\\". When all is said and done, \\\"Nine Songs\\\" evoked a truly unique and loving response from me, in spite of the fact that as a film, it fails in many areas. I would not say that many films should be made like this, but I would say that it is flirting with a new form of love story that is raw, beautiful and in the end, no matter how many times it fails, honest by the sheer default of it's topic.\", \"helpful\": [\"75\", \"108\"], \"title\": \"9 songs\", \"year\": \"2004\"}, {\"review_id\": \"rw1155252\", \"reviewer\": \"t-excel\", \"movie\": \"Unleashed (2005)\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"review_summary\": \"Lovin' it !!!!\", \"review_date\": \"21 August 2005\", \"spoiler_tag\": 0, \"review_detail\": \"What can i say accept \\\"great\\\".

It was a voice that sent chills down my spine. That hypnotic voice, that chilling presence, is nowhere to be found in Oliver Hirschbeigel's Downfall, a powerful but novelistic account of the events that took place in Berlin during the final days of the Second World War. Bruno Ganz portrays the F\\u00fchrer as a broken and defeated man, stooped and palsied, raving about how his generals betrayed him, yet being kind to his wife Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler), his secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), and his dog Blondi. It is a strong performance and his character fascinates us, yet Ganz' fiery rants as the F\\u00fchrer seem to be overly studied, not emanating from the core of his being.The film is based on Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich by Joachim Fest and the memoir Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary by Traudl Junge and Melissa Muller, and is shot mainly within the confines of a closed space that approximates the dimensions of the real bunker. In that oppressive atmosphere, Ganz recreates the physical deterioration and emotional instability of the F\\u00fchrer who remains steadfast while everything around him is crumbling. Although faced with certain defeat, soldiers are still being sent to their death while Hitler insists that \\\"every square meter\\\" of German territory must be defended or left behind as \\\"scorched earth\\\". Those that do not fight are shot on the spot as traitors.The city, however, is unable to defend itself against the continuing onslaught of Russian troops. Although military men know that there is no hope, no one is willing to challenge the F\\u00fchrer's orders or attempt to seize power. Many opt for suicide or go on drinking binges to obscure the failure of the military effort, although by that time, one of Hitler's chief objectives had been achieved with the annihilation of two-thirds of European Jews. As Hitler's wife Eva Braun throws lavish parties, the sound of artillery shells and bombs shake the bunker's walls. Both Eva and Traudl are shown as being so infatuated with Hitler that they dismiss reports of military failure and imminent death. Juliane Kohler portrays Eva Braun as a decent but superficial young woman, thinking only of serving the Third Reich. Lara depicts Traudl as young, apolitical, and hopelessly naive, the way Traudl views herself in her memoirs without ever discussing the impact her father's Nazi membership had on her life.Hirschbeigel prides himself on his adherence to the truth and Downfall is, by and large, historically accurate. The film, however, singles out a few individuals for being \\\"good Nazis\\\" and does not always tell the entire story. One idealized is Albert Speer, Hitler's architect, who tells the F\\u00fchrer that he did not follow his orders to destroy the infrastructure in German cities. This did take courage, yet Speer's organizational genius is said to have prolonged the war for at least a year, with the consequent death of hundreds of thousands and widespread ruin. Hermann Fegelin, Eva Braun's brother-in-law is shown as being ready to question the fawning mentality of the German army, yet he was also a member of the Nazi SS, responsible for the killing of thousands of Jews. In another half truth, the doctor, Professor Schenk appears to be a selfless hero in treating the wounded, yet this was the same man who was responsible for the death of hundreds at Dachau during forced labor projects and medical experiments.Despite its weaknesses, Downfall has a great deal of merit and it should be seen if only to appreciate the insanity of war and what can occur in a country where basic freedoms are denied. Of the many outstanding performances, two that deserve mention are Ulrich Matthes as the cold hearted Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbles and his wife Magda played by Corinna Harfouch. The sequence in which she calmly poisons her six children because she does not want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism are among the most horrifying I have ever seen. Another performance worthy of mention is that of 13-year old Donevan Gunia whose Peter Kranz represents the crumbling facade of the Hitler youth.At the end, Hitler is a pathetic shell of his former self who refuses to admit his mistakes and begins to suffer from depression, spending his hours thinking of the best way to commit suicide. No compromise or surrender is ever contemplated though it might have saved thousands of lives. Hirschbeigel wants us to see that Hitler was just a flawed human being but human nonetheless. If this helps the German people to release feelings of guilt, it will have made a big contribution to world sanity. However, showing that Hitler had a human side does not help us to understand the man or his abhorrence of \\\"the dirty and degrading chimera called conscience and morality,\\\" as well as \\\"the burden of free will\\\" and \\\"personal responsibility\\\" which he thought should only be left to those in positions of power.Hitler may have been a good boss to his secretary and a kind husband but he never showed any signs of remorse when people died because of his actions. It was reported that Hitler used to laugh when Joseph Goebbels described the sufferings of the Jews. He once remarked that a guilty conscience was a Jewish invention. If he had some human qualities, they pale in significance with the breadth of his crimes that have attained an almost mythical dimension. In his devotion to achieving his ends through the use of unbridled physical strength and cruelty, he surpassed all his predecessors in his inhumanity and those are the terms in which he should be forever defined.\", \"helpful\": [\"0\", \"1\"], \"title\": \"downfall\", \"year\": \"2004\"}, {\"review_id\": \"rw1212077\", \"reviewer\": \"jacksragingbileduct99\", \"movie\": \"Cold Mountain (2003)\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"review_summary\": \"A Taste of Everything\", \"review_date\": \"9 November 2005\", \"spoiler_tag\": 0, \"review_detail\": \"This film struck me as.......cruel; with regards to the animal-slaying scenes.

Rolling a blind-eye, and power-rolling a car window, to violence on the streets.But instead of taking one of these topics and really opening up the humanity and inhumanity clashing within it, the film is too busy making its rapid getaway from illumination towards an imitation of entertainment.

Adapted from the 1953 novel by Georges Simenon and set to Debussy's elegantly creepy Nuages, writer-director Cedric Kahn offers up movie with attributes of a Hitchcockian suspense thriller.The feeling of foreboding begins immediately when we meet Antoine Dunant (Jean-Pierre Darroussin a low-level insurance executive. He's just leaving his job to meet his beautiful wife H\\u00e9l\\u00e8ne (Carole Bouquet) in a local caf\\u00e9. They are planning to drive to the countryside from Paris to pick up their kids from summer camp.But as soon as Antoine gets to the caf\\u00e9 he guzzles three beers back to back with one eye on the street lest his wife arrive before he's suitably fortified. It soon becomes pretty obvious that their marriage is far from happy - Antoine armed with enough drink to sink an elephant, settles into a manner of truculent impetuosity, while Helene remains detached, cold, and almost abusive.While in the road, Helen discovers that her husband is utterly plastered. She hardly says anything as he weaves all over the road, but her silence speaks volumes. Thus starts a trip of barely controlled hostility with the husband clenching the wheel and brooding, while the wife fumes beside him. Both are so busy bickering with each other and thinking dark thoughts that they're half oblivious to news reports of an escaped convict on the loose nearby.Antoine isn't usually a drinker, but something has snapped in him, and as the neon signs of the roadside bars start to beckon him, he becomes obsessed with downing as much cold beer and whisky as he can. He leaves Helene angrily waiting in the car while he goes into yet another bar, to prepare himself for the long night ahead.H\\u00e9l\\u00e8ne, freaked by his increasing belligerence and inability to drive in a straight line, abandons her husband to look for a train station. Meanwhile Antoine strikes up a conversation with a reserved one-armed stranger (Vincent Deniard).When, minutes later, the stranger steps out of the parking-lot shadows, his face half hidden by the hood of a sweatshirt, and asks for a ride, the cocky, staggering Antoine doesn't even break stride. By now he's so sweaty and drunk that he waves the fellow right into the car.What follows is detour into a night of terror for Antoine, Helene, and for the viewer. The movie starts to resemble everyone's nightmare - the inexplicable disappearance of a loved one. And as Antoine embarks on a desperate journey to track his wife down, it soon becomes clear that Red Lights is really showing us a portrait of a marriage, a marriage that has been enigmatically hanging by a thread.Their need to see the children again is probably just a way of distracting them from the aridness of their relationship. She's beautiful and accomplished, while he plain and dull. Somehow the couple began their marriage as equals, but she soon eclipsed him, for which he can't forgive her. Other than this, Kahn provides very little reason as to why their relationship has suddenly gone sour.What Kahn does provide, however, is the knowledge that marriage can often dissipate completely, leave two strangers in a car, totally sick of each other, in desperate need of a reviving shock to the system. But when the sun finally rises, and Antoine is released from his drunken hell, Kahn does provide a dash of hope for the couple.In the end, Red Lights is showing that relationships are frail and that the machinations of marriage are often inexplicable. And if nothing else, Antoine and Helen show that it can all dramatically and irrevocably change and fall apart in a searing flash of red light.

She has a terribly affected accent - especially when singing, and has to live down a cinematic image which began with Mary Poppins and was dragged to the bottom of the pit by having to make the best of a truly appalling role as Maria in the Sound of Music. In this film, however, she shows herself as being a performer of some ability. I have seen Gertrude Lawrence in films. In my opinion, Ms Andrews is a better performer - in films, at any rate - than Gertrude Lawrence ever was. Ms Andrews shows a pretty good range of acting muses: her portrayal when drunk at the party was particularly good.Having said that, the script and the storyline are not particularly good. Some of the facts of Gertrude Lawrence's life are not correct. For instance we have Bruce Forsyth playing Ms Lawrence's cockney father. As I recall, Gertrude Lawrence's father was a Dane named Clausen or Klaasen or something. Bruce Forsyth er ikke saa dansk, although he is, of course, an effective performer.Her husband Richard Stoddard Aldridge - as the dialogue calls attention to - talks like a contract. And this is annoying. Gertrude Lawrence herself in this film is pretty two-dimensional, although that is the fault of the scriptwriter rather than the actress, who does her best with what she has been given. Of the musical numbers, I liked the Jenny number the best.In summary, this film, for all its faults, is worth watching if only to see Julie Andrews make an almighty effort to shrug off the little miss goody goody two shoes image she got saddled with in The Sound of Music.\", \"helpful\": [\"4\", \"5\"], \"title\": \"star!\", \"year\": \"1968\"}, {\"review_id\": \"rw1229526\", \"reviewer\": \"ccthemovieman-1\", \"movie\": \"Plunder Road (1957)\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"review_summary\": \"An Odd-But-Interesting Film Noir\", \"review_date\": \"2 December 2005\", \"spoiler_tag\": 0, \"review_detail\": \"This is another of those \\\"Poverty Row\\\" film noirs, a crime movie made on a low budget but yet decently acted and certainly entertaining.Gene Raymond and Elisha Cook Jr. are known actors to classic film buffs but the rest of the cast may not be too familiar.

Like \\\"Broken Wings (Knafayim Shvurot),\\\" this is an Israeli family with teenagers struggling with apolitical grief, but that was a secular family. Like \\\"Upside of Anger,\\\" there's a grieving mom struggling with teenage daughters as all are dealing with their loneliness and sexuality. Like \\\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\\" and \\\"Smooth Talk,\\\" it deals with teen girls susceptibility to guys. \\\"Saved!\\\" showed teens dealing with some these issues in a comparable conservative community, but satirically unsympathetic. Here instead we have a mother in a situation that would be difficult in any time, any place. The mother has just finished her year of mourning for her husband and is at loose ends, financially, emotionally and as a now single parent of daughters anxious to get on with their lives. All three are vulnerable to persuasion. But they happen to be a modern Orthodox family in Israel so their normal developmental stages are buffeted by religious and social strictures on their behavior. The mother is attracted to the possibility of joining her husband's friends in a group to found a West Bank settlement, more for the companionship and structure it would give to her and her family's life than for zealotry. I'm sure American audiences miss a lot of the political references during scenes of organizing committee meetings, applicant interviews and singing, sloganeering and film viewing (let alone subtleties involved with types and angles of head coverings and length of skirts worn, eating habits and the summer fast day of Tisha b'Av), but the diversity of motivations and social hypocrisy of many of those involved does come through. Going through the process of dealing with these friends and their expectations makes her stronger as an individual, particularly as she reflects on her marriage and what she wants from future relationships.The triangle of the younger and older women's relationships is among the most emotionally frank I've seen on film in its honesty about insecurities, confusions and peer pressure in male-female relationships, symbolized throughout by the father's car and how they and the guys around them deal with it. While the mother is pushed to re-enter the dating pool and explores a relationship with some similarity to how Catherine Keener sweetly handles \\\"The 40 Year Old Virgin,\\\" the older daughter focuses on her one-track minded hunky soldier boyfriend, seems to be rebelliously secular and is opposed to moving. The younger daughter absorbs all these contradictory signals. There's a marvelous scene of her exuberantly dancing to romantic pop music at home by herself that is straight out of \\\"My So-Called Life\\\" (or the totemic equivalent for guys \\\"Risky Business\\\") to show that in the U.S. she'd be considered a typical teen ager. Her curiosity about boys is therefore not surprising, so that the adults around her seem rigidly clueless in not expecting that restlessness from her when the appeal of the bad boy is clearly universal. There are occasional references to the complexities of a diversifying Israel that Americans can understand, as when the mother comments the B'nei Akiva youth group isn't the same as when she was young. The actresses are refreshingly not Hollywood beautiful, though it is clearly a running visual joke when the safe guy choices are not just nerdy but are bursting their untucked shirt buttons, even as it is sympathetic to their pressures as well, making the alternatives that much more attractive.While this is no \\\"Norma Rae\\\" or \\\"My Brilliant Career\\\" as a feminist tract, nor is it the anti-Orthodox agit-prop of \\\"Kadosh,\\\" the film has a strong, fair and balanced humanistic and sweetly forgiving point to make about women in a male-dominated society who are expected to act a certain way and the consequences they face when they step out of line -- and how the men who love them can be supportive as they learn to live together. While \\\"Campfire\\\" is distributed unrated by the MPAA in the U.S., as a parent I would give it a PG-13.

Dark Water is one more of the Hollywood's adaptations of Asian horror movies. Once again they use Hideo Nakata's successfully created material. And they hire a foreign director that has had success with two of a list of movies, Diarios de Motocicleta and Estaci\\u00f3n do Brasil were both critically acclaimed. But was he ready to direct a horror flick? It seem like he wasn't or maybe the producers are the bad guys here and he is the next John Carpenter, who knows? The script is quite a mess; it only shows one scene of high tension and desperation felt by one of the characters at the end of the movie. Desperation is the source of fear, we can only feel the fear that exudes characters if they are in danger or they feel that way, this is quintessential in horror and it's the reason why Dark Water almost has no real scaring scenes. Dark Water has an intimate way of story-telling, showing how the supporting characters are when they hide their true nature. But at the end this works against the final result due to a not so little unfinished subplot involving the father of Ceci. Many movies with more ridiculous premises and much less budget are more respectful to what is horror. The last half of Dark Water is better than the first half. The last half doesn't show new ideas but at least tries to give some satisfaction to the audience. One can imagine Dahlia having this imaginary thought \\\"oh yeah, there's a ghost in my house, well I'll deal with that once I have solved my familiar problems (?????)\\\" or at least it looks like that is the posture of Jennifer Connelly's Dhalia.Jennifer Connelly's performance is adequate, even tough in the highly dramatic scenes she shares with Ariel Gade (her fictional daughter) the result is erratic she seems too theatrical and Ariel appears as a dull young actress. Dealing the movie mainly with the whole mother-daughter motto this is not an insignificant matter. Tim Roth's performance is a redeeming note, he is an amazing actor in supporting roles (remember Pulp Fiction?) here he creates one interesting lawyer.The music and cinematography are way too standard also. The score is the average for a psychological horror-thriller work but the cinematography has some shots that look too raw for a blockbuster like this one unless the intention was create something stylish but it certainly doesn't look good.\", \"helpful\": [\"0\", \"2\"], \"title\": \"dark water\", \"year\": \"2005\"}, {\"review_id\": \"rw1149736\", \"reviewer\": \"claudio_carvalho\", \"movie\": \"Twins of Evil (1971)\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"review_summary\": \"Another Excellent Production of Hammer\", \"review_date\": \"14 August 2005\", \"spoiler_tag\": 1, \"review_detail\": \"In the Nineteenth Century, the twin sisters Maria Gellhorn (Mary Collinson) and Frieda Gellhorn (Madeleine Collinson) become orphans and come from the progressive Venice to a small town the country of England in the lands of the Count Karnstein (Damien Thomas), who worships the devil, to live with their uncle Gustav Weil (Peter Cushing).

The theme song is fantastic, and you hear very different variations of it throughout the movie.

The love portrayed between Elizabeth Bennet (Kira Knightley) and Mr.Darcy ( Matthew MacFadyen) was at its best. The level of romance between the characters in situations such as, the scene where Mr. Darcy assisted Ms. Bennet into the carriage, the confrontation at proposal and the final scenes all were romantic at amazingly precise level for the time the film took place. It brings back a legitimate and perfect love to a world overzealous with sexuality. It was decent and romantic and I applaud Joe for giving such a sweet vision into love without pride or prejudice.Then again, in other areas the movie lacked. In comparison to the novel and the BBC television series the part of Elizabeth Bennet was weak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong woman figure and Kightley did not play a satisfying part. Kira was not bold enough to be called a Elizabeth Bennet perhaps she lacks experience in acting but she needed a bit more maturity and presence to fulfill the role. Mr. Darcy in this movie in comparison to a Colin Firth's acting in the BBC edition was good. Although Firth had a better grasp of the characters pride MacFadyen like Firth had a commanding presence and was awfully romantic. I believe both Firth and Macfadyen played Darcy very well. What really upset me, although minor, was the appearance of the Bennet family and the country people. They looked dirty and Elizabeth's Bennet hair was always a mess. The Bennets status was not so low and in the past at there appropriate status woman always fixed themselves up exceptionally well it was disappointing to see Kira look so when she had such a high potential to look good. Not every thing is appearance but you don't have to be so terrible put together. Mr.Bingley in the movie was fantastic, I really enjoyed his acting. Thus, the movie was great but there it was flawed.

I always thought they picked all the wrong actors, the child characters became chartoonish and slapstick, and the screenplay is some of the hokiest, most clich\\u00e9d stuff written (Especially the first film). However I feel that they are improving with age, and that GoF is the best yet.I understand that there are so many 'purists' who hate the films because they leave out so much of the books' content. But the films need to stand alone, and shouldn't be compared to the books. I was initially upset after watching the film as I realised there was a lot left out, but would you really want to see this book made into two films? The first film would be this long introduction that is exciting in the novels, but would be boring and stretched out when translated into the film. The first film would be 2 hours of Harry Potter before he even starts the first task. Plus aside from that the actors would all look strangely years older than before when the 2nd of the GoF film was released, and they are growing up too fast as it is.The action was kept fast-paced although I felt had I not read the book, I would have no idea what was happening (especially at the end with the 'Priori Incuntatum (excuse the spelling)', as all Dumbledore did was say the those words and then move on. However most of it was kept well organised, and I think they kept enough of the book's detail in to sustain the film.At last, for all these years, the makers have promise a darker Harry film, and finally we have it. Scary, brooding and not for the very young, it captures the feel of the book, which I don't think the others did.The older actors are all fantastic, especially Maggie Smith, who steals every one of the few scenes she has in the film, Brendon Gleeson, who is clearly loving being Mad-Eye-Moody, and finally Ralph Fiennes, who creates a chilling Voldemort that we have all been waiting for. The only adult I am slightly unsure of is Michael Gambon (Dumbledore). I know that he has tried to make Dumbledore his own, but at times he seems quite violent and shouty, a far cry from Richard Harris's portrayal. However, I do think he succeeds in making Dumbledore more human - in this film he really doesn't have the answers, through the previous books/films he was always there, all-knowing. But now he is unsure, and it effects him.The child actors are improving with age, some faster than others. Emma Watson (who's Hermione in the first film was embarrassing), is the best out of the trio by far. She has a lot of emotional scenes, and she cries very well for her age! Rupert Grint is not bad, but is still left with the lines that make the 6 year olds in the audience laugh, but it is Daniel Radcliffe who is still unimpressive. With all due credit, he is SO much better in this film, and that could be down to direction, or just coming of age. His emotional scenes when he is crying at Cedric's body are actually moving instead of the laughable scene in PoA (\\\"He was their friend etc etc\\\") which was cringe-worthy. Hopefully he'll be better again in the next film.The special effects are fantastic, and the dialogue is less cheesy but still pleases the younger audience.Bring on Order of the Pheonix!\", \"helpful\": [\"0\", \"0\"], \"title\": \"harry potter and the goblet of fire\", \"year\": \"2005\"}, {\"review_id\": \"rw1208698\", \"reviewer\": \"mpndas213\", \"movie\": \"American Beauty (1999)\", \"rating\": 1.0, \"review_summary\": \"off-the-scale pretentious\", \"review_date\": \"4 November 2005\", \"spoiler_tag\": 1, \"review_detail\": \"this movie is as moving and insightful as a fart. the director and his actors have no grasp whatsoever of the human condition. instead of giving an accurate or interesting snapshot of humanity they chose to create some sort of suburban nightmare and allow a bunch of hateful and inhumane people inhabit it. the scene wherein the paper blowing around is filmed and called \\\"beautiful\\\" by one of the \\\"actors\\\" in this flick sums it up for me. i.e. if you call it beauty, then people will want to fawn over, look and act like it. in this case, and in the case of the movie, it was just trash. you and i were scammed. and the academy did its usual part by praising this garbage to the sky. only in the case of titanic has a movie been less deserving of an award.\", \"helpful\": [\"3\", \"5\"], \"title\": \"american beauty\", \"year\": \"1999\"}, {\"review_id\": \"rw1238550\", \"reviewer\": \"RightLeftMiddle\", \"movie\": \"Finding Neverland (2004)\", \"rating\": 10.0, \"review_summary\": \"Imagination creates the \\\"neverland\\\"\", \"review_date\": \"14 December 2005\", \"spoiler_tag\": 1, \"review_detail\": \"The movie was so sad, but it was wonderful.

I decided to give it a shot and was glad I did, as it has given me quite a memorable movie experience.Melinda Sordino (Stewart) is a high school freshman, who was once a bright, happy student.

She regresses and rarely speaks to anyone, even to the few who try to reach out to her. One person does manage to break through, her new art teacher, Mr. Freeman (Zahn), who gets Melinda to slowly express her emotions through her art projects. She tries to regain the confidence to open back up and ultimately break free of the shell she has created for herself.This movie is definitely not a feel-good flick, but the screenplay (adapted from the same-titled book) affords some light moments (usually from Melinda's observations through her inner monologue and rare interactions in the classroom). Stewart is truly the revelation here as she perfectly nails the depressed and isolated role of Melinda and can deftly handle the couple of pretty harrowing incidents that occur. She is definitely one to watch for in the future. Zahn, usually cast for comedic parts, pulls off his best performance. The scene towards the end of the movie between Mr. Freeman and Melinda in her \\\"safe place\\\", was enough to bring me to tears, even though there were barely any words spoken.
